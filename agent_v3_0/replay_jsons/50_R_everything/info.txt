VS TITA about 10th game in

Lights:
- unit12 what is it doing on turn 6 to 10 (not moving)
- where does it start going from 11 and then why does it change it's mind at 16
- why does it stop chasing at 20 (it has more  power than enemy)
- why does it get stepped on at 23/24


- unit 24 ~turn 30 has similar issues fighting with unit 11 (again it has more power than enemy)

- unit 21 turn 30 -- why does  it take such a long path back to factory

- unit 13 turn 24 -- why doe it get actions with a bunch of moving before pickup, then a bunch more moving before dig
- unit 13 turn 59 -- why does it walk into heavy unit 7 (on factory)
- unit 19 turn 80 -- was pathing to ore, but then gets near enemy, why does it path back to factory first while on full power?
	turn 110 -- why does it get assigned no actions
	turn 199-205 -- oscillates between mining in two locations never actually mining
	turn 232 -- stops acting while fighting even though it has more power
Heavy:
- unit 7 turn 37 -- why does it run away from the light enemy unit 15 and then choose a path running around the  factory?
- unit 7 turn 45 -- gets new path but not enough power to do moves before pickup of power
	turn 215 -- why does it get NOTHING action when light approaches it
	turn 219 -- why does it try to go to far away resource?
- unit 6 turn 68-90 -- Needs to not keep picking up a bit more power before setting off
